# Temperature_Controlled_Fan_System_using_2MCUs
Temperature Controls the Fan speed ,the lights and the machine

### <br>We have 2 states:
##### <br>1.Normal state:
* If temperature is less than 20 --> Fan is off and Green light is on
* If temperature is greater than 20 and less than 30 --> Fan is on and Green light is on
* If tempreature is greater than 30 and less than 40 --> Fan is on and Yellow light is on
* If tempreature is greater than 40 and less than 50 --> Fan is on with its maximum speed and Yellow Red light is on
